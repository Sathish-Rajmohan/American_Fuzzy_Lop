**Mini Lop Fuzzing Framework**
This repository contains an advanced Python-based gray-box fuzzing framework compatible with AFL instrumentation. The framework enhances traditional fuzzing methodologies through intelligent seed management, sophisticated mutation strategies, and real-time coverage feedback for automated vulnerability discovery.

**Features:**
1. Coverage-guided testing with global edge coverage tracking
2. Advanced havoc mutation with multi-strategy approaches
3. Intelligent seed prioritization based on AFL algorithms
4. Power scheduling considering execution speed and coverage metrics
5. AFL-compatible forkserver and shared memory integration
6. Real-time analytics with live coverage tracking and crash detection
7. Modular architecture for extensible functionality

**Tech Stack:**
* Python 3.x for core fuzzing logic
* AFL Instrumentation for target program analysis
* Shared Memory for real-time coverage feedback
* Forkserver Protocol for efficient target execution
* TOML Configuration for flexible parameter management
* Docker for dependency management and deployment

**Status:** Research prototype - successfully tested against mJS JavaScript engine and cJSON parser with enhanced coverage discovery and crash detection capabilities.
